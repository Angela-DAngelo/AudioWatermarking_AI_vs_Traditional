# 🎵 AudioWatermarking_AI_vs_Traditional

### Comparative Study of AI-based and Traditional Audio Watermarking Methods

This repository accompanies the research work *"Assessing Progress over a Decade of Digital Audio Watermarking Research"* (IEEE Access, 2024).

This project provides a systematic comparison between **traditional signal-processing** and **AI-based** audio watermarking methods.  
We implemented the classical **STAMP** system and benchmarked it against three state-of-the-art neural approaches - **AudioSeal**, **WavMark**, and **SilentCipher** - across diverse datasets (speech, multilingual speech, and music) and a wide range of perturbations.

## 💡 Overview

Digital audio watermarking is a core technology for copyright protection, authenticity verification, and synthetic media detection.  
While recent AI-based models have been proposed for watermark embedding and detection, their actual robustness compared to traditional designs remains uncertain.

This project evaluates both paradigms under identical conditions, assessing:
- **Imperceptibility**
- **Robustness**
- **Bit recovery accuracy**

The repository includes implementations, benchmarks, and evaluation tools used in the comparative study.  
It aims to provide a **reproducible experimental framework** for researchers and practitioners interested in testing or extending audio watermarking methods under standardized conditions.

Overall, the results highlight that **classical signal-processing systems** still achieve competitive and often superior robustness compared to modern neural architectures, emphasizing the enduring value of traditional design principles in contemporary audio watermarking.
