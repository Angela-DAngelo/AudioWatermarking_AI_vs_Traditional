### AudioMark

The **AudioMark** dataset refers to **AudioMarkBench**, introduced by Liu *et al.* in *“AudioMarkBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Audio Watermarking”* (NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2024), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness and fairness of audio watermarking methods under demographic and linguistic diversity. 

The dataset is derived from the *Mozilla Common Voice* corpus, which provides balanced coverage across **25 languages**, **two genders (male/female)**, and **four age groups** (teens, twenties, thirties, forties). Each audio sample has a maximum duration of **5 seconds** and is standardized at a **16 kHz sampling rate**.


For our evaluation, we selected **200 clips** uniformly distributed across all demographic attributes to ensure balanced and representative testing conditions.
