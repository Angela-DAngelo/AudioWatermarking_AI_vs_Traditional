### AudioMark

The **AudioMark** refers to **AudioMarkBench**, introduced by Liu *et al.* in *“AudioMarkBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Audio Watermarking”* (NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks Track, 2024) — is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the **robustness and fairness** of audio watermarking methods under demographic and linguistic diversity [10].

The **AudioMarkData** subset is derived from the *Mozilla Common Voice* corpus, which provides balanced coverage across **25 languages**, **two genders (male/female)**, and **four age groups** (teens, twenties, thirties, forties).  
Each audio sample has a maximum duration of **5 seconds** and is standardized at a **16 kHz sampling rate**.

For our evaluation, we selected **200 clips** uniformly distributed across all demographic attributes to ensure balanced and representative testing conditions.
